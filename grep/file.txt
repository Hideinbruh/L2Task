Once upon a time there lived a young farmer. He worked very hard but was very poor.
One day when he was far from home in the forest, an old woman looking like a peasant
came up to him and said, «I know you work very hard, and all for nothing. I will give
you a magic ring! It will make you rich, and your work won’t be in vain. When you turn
the ring on your finger and say what you wish to have, you’ll have it at once! But there
is only one wish in the ring, so think carefully before you wish.
